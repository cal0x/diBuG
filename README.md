##diBuG - Windows debugger		
	1. Debugger:
		- Set breakpoints
		- Read register
		
	2. Memory:
		- Write bytes
		- Read bytes
		- Scan memory for value
		- Set memory scan filter ( R, W, RW, From - To, etc )
		
The debugger will be very easy like I explain it here:
http://blog.cal0x.com/2014/09/breakpoints.html
And I show it in this pseudo code:

The debugger is finished in different projects and closed for now.
